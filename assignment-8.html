    <div id="illustration">
    <p>This man was once born from a rock, and was a rock. Many years passed with nothing to happen. Until the Lord came near during his 40 day fast, who tripped and fell and bled as human, but His divine power from his body splashed as blood onto this rock. and one day the rock became a little more like human when he heard the worship of God nearby, which brought him to life. Since that day he has lived to worship and sing and and make music for God. In present day he is known as DJ Rock Blood.</p>
